### The casing parts do not fit together
> [!TIP]
> First, check that you have removed all the protective film from the casing components.  
> It may happen that the side walls of the clock do not want to fit into the cut-out slots on the bottom and top plates. This is due to the unevenness of the plexiglass plates from which the casing components are cut. In this case, do not use force when assembling the casing because it may crack. Gently file the holes and/or tabs in the casing using a knife, file or sandpaper. **Remember do not use force!**
